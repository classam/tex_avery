### Master Arc: The Quest To Regain $NAME's Identity ###
 * Character Creation & Intro
    * The game starts in your bathroom.  You wake up, woozy and Disconnected, 
    in a bathtub, sore and uncomfortable. There's drying blood about. Your
    arm is clumsily wrapped in gauze. 

    When you get up, to get out of the tub, you see yourself in the mirror, 
    Which allows you to establish basic details about your appearance. 
 * You learn that you're missing your Authenticat
 * Apartment
    * A Vancouver micro-studio. 384 sq.ft. It has a separate bathroom,
    and bedroom/living/kitchen, all of which are quite cramped. 

    Next to your bed is an input/output stack of dirty and clean 
    laundry in hampers. Your clothes are composed mostly of novelty
    T-shirts covering funny things that have since happened on the 
    internet and been forgotten, and faded jeans. 

    You put on a shirt referencing an online joke where a person 
    posted a humorous bad review of water on furrycurry.int 
    "WATER: Crucial for life; A little bland. C+." 

    4000 of these sold in the first day, at which point the interest
    in the joke waned and your company discontinued the shirts.
    * On the way out, you run into your building manager, who reminds you that
    rent's due in 8 days, and if you don't pay, you're out. 
    * If you leave naked, you can't get back into your apartment without a long
    and awful conversation with your building manager. Also, you get cold very
    quickly and can't use your inventory. 
 * Stadium/Chinatown Map
    * Your next move is probably Police Station, Library, or Skytrain=>Airport
 * Library: 
    * The Library has pay-phones, but the thin phone directories contain
    precious few phone numbers; they're mostly giant indices of 
    assorted businesses. In order to avoid perpetual telespam, most
    of your family and friends are unlisted. 

    You do, however, know the number for emergency services, who 
    agree to send a constable to your apartment. 

    * Police Report 
      * Call the police from the public phone.  
      * The police will advise you as to how to recover your identity.
      * Talking to the police will also provide back-fill. 
      * Make an appointment with AuthentiCat's Recovery Department. 
        * Earliest available appointment is always X days in the future.  
        * ( The minute you recover your identity, you quash any chance of tracking your assailant.) 

 * You can get a cheap Pay As You Go data plan and terminal from a TELUX kiosk. 
    * It's expensive to make calls and surf the web on this thing. 
    * the TELUX terminal is locked - you can only use the PaYG plan data included. 
      You can't install software, you can't connect to open networks.
      It's pretty limited.
    * Character References
      * Use the terminal to call your co-workers, Ennis Laoghaire and Shani Djamila
      * They're not available. That's strange, they're usually always online. 
        (They have also been chipjacked)
 * You're not the only one: 
    * There's been a rash of surgical identity thefts. 
    * (Including _both_ of your co-workers.)
 * Chip-hacking For Fun & Profit
    * At the library, you meet a person who claims to know all about hacking, but
      is actually mostly just an excitable script-kiddie. 
      * He invites you to stop by the local Hackerspace, which is hosted in one of
        the Library public rooms. 
    * At the Hackerspace, they can unlock your terminal. 

 * Airport: 
    * Oh, hey, air travel is bankrupt. The Airport is mostly occupied by squatters. 
    * The first time you visit the Airport, you're caught up in a Flash Riot. 
 * Who Did This? Tracking the chip-thief. 
 * Why? Unearthing a grand conspiracy. 
    * It was a TELUX marketing team, preparing for a product launch and looking to 
      piggyback on your influence to generate positive word-of-mouth. When they 
      were outbid by Magnaminoux, they decided to take matters into their own hand'
      by contracting out your identity theft to tmiyoh.3am (TakeMattersIntoYourOwnHands), 
      an agency that provides a marketplace for contracting Enterprise Shady Doings for 
      corporate clients at very reasonable rates.

    * Your bank account is emptied and your company is stripped of its assets. 
      You dissolve the company and get a 9-7 with TELUX's creative department. 
* Time's Up: Miss your Identity Appointment or your Rent Payment

* Blackmail Success: Record the Surgeon's Next Hit, take it to the Surgeon, then take his confession to TELUX HQ
    * They offer to put you up in a nice hotel, restore your identity, and pay you off.
    * They do. With "Fuck You" money and a beach house in Providenciales.

Police Report
-------------

They send Police Constable 1st Class Jeanne Javert.

#### Javert ####

She will ask you to relate the events of your last evening, which
will give the player a chance to hear about them for the first time.

You and your coworkers were out celebrating. A recent article called
out you and your small team as zeitgeist-chasers - which amped up
the bidding from companies looking to use your influence to be 
perceived as the zeitgeist.  After some very fierce bidding on 
zlick.zap, you sold the rights to your next t-shirt design to 
Magnaminoux for their "Lust After" line of post-coital flannel nighties
for enough money to keep your team lazy for the next five or six years.
Magnaminoux narrowly outbid TELUX ("The Future Is Coming", an ad
campaign focused on high-bandwidth pornography streaming). 

There was drinking and revelry, but after a few drinks it all gets
fuzzy and goes black. 

If you show her your scar, she will note that it looks to have been
a reasonably skilled extraction job.

She gives you a contact cube - a portable single-contact cel-phone -
that you can use to call her during normal work hours in the case 
that you learn something useful, or in the case that she needs to 
contact you for some reason. She also gives you a case reference
code, "JJ-29-54".

#### Hakaa Desu ####

Near the phones is a man, Khorshid Vesa, delivering a presentation on 
a technology that is optimistic, open, free, distributed, and totally 
impractical to a small group of confused seniors who are just here for
the free coffee. 

Khorshid is happy to discuss it with you. If you're wearing a TELUX 
PaYG locked headset, he'll mention how restricted it is, and mention
that the Hackerspace Goons would be happy to help you unlock it and 
install a GNU/Linux distribution ("Eyebuntu?" "ArchDeluxe?). 

Should you unlock the device, you'll be free of TELUX's expensive
tyranny, able to connect for free in locations with open networks
and install software as you please - but your use of the system is
limited by the new and mostly unfamiliar OS. 

### TELUX Kiosk ###

TELUX Kiosks are all over the place - including one in the Library.

You can, with some of your limited money supply, buy a small 
portable terminal with a Pay-As-You-Go data plan, and $10 top-up
cards to keep the data flowing. 

With the portable terminal, you can fish contact information for
your co-workers out of the system.
