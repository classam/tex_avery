$NAME's Quest
-------------

### Master Arc: The Quest To Regain Stanley's Identity ###
 * Character Creation: 
    * Your actions in your apartment in the beginning of the game largely
      determine the nature of your character. 
 * Identity Verification: 
    * Police Report 
      * Call the police from a phone ( a public phone can be found at Library or Airport ) 
      * The police will advise you as to how to recover your identity
      * Make an appointment with AuthentiCat's Recovery Department. 
        * Earliest available appointment is always X days in the future.  
    * Character References
      * Use a terminal to call your co-workers
      * They're not available. That's strange, they're usually always online. 
 * You can get a cheap Pay As You Go data plan and terminal from a TELUX kiosk. 
    * It's expensive to make calls and surf the web on this thing. 
    * the TELUX terminal is locked - you can only use the PaYG plan data included. 
      You can't install software, you can't connect to open networks.
      It's pretty limited.
 * You're not the only one: 
    * There's been a rash of surgical identity thefts. 
    * (Including _both_ of your co-workers.)
 * Chip-hacking For Fun & Profit
    * At the library, you meet a person who claims to know all about hacking, but
      is actually a bit of a meathead. 
      * He invites you to stop by the local Hackerspace. 
    * At the Hackerspace, they can unlock your terminal. 
      * They're quite friendly.  
 * Who Did This? Tracking the chip-thief. 
 * Why? Unearthing a grand conspiracy. 


### Endings: ###

* Good Little Bureaucrat: Follow all of the instructions to get your identity back.
 * You regain your identity, but never learn exactly what happened.
 * Your bank account is emptied and your company is stripped of its assets. 
   You dissolve the company and get a 9-7 with TELUX's creative department. 
* Absurdist Fantasy: Kill an NPC, perform a series of unusual operations.
 * You were an unresponsive the entire time. 


Locations
---------

### The Bathroom ###

The game starts in your bathroom.  You wake up, woozy and Disconnected, 
in a bathtub, sore and uncomfortable. There's drying blood about. Your
arm is clumsily wrapped in gauze. 

When you get up, to get out of the tub, you see yourself in the mirror, 
Which allows you to establish basic details about your appearance. 

#### You ####

Name:
 * NAME 

You identify as:
 * Male
 * Female
 * It's Complicated

If your skin color were a refreshing beer, it would be a
 * Hefeveisen
 * Lager
 * Amber Ale
 * Stout

Your hair is 
 * Short & Black
 * Medium & Brown
 * Long & Blonde
 * It's impossible to tell behind the luchadore mask. (Absurd++) 

You're not wearing any clothes. 

You have a long tattoo of an asian-style dragon running from
your thighbone up the side of your torso, alongside the chinese
character for "SOUP".  It was a funny nod to a common joke 
("The tattoo artist said it meant 'Honor'") at the time, but you're
starting to regret it. 

You work as a graphic designer at a local T-Shirt design 
collective that specializes in extremely fast print 
runs of shirts featuring up-to-the minute internet memes, 
selling these shirts during the memes' exact window of 
popularity, and then forgetting the shirts entirely and forever. 

You work with Ennis Laoghaire, who works with local 
screen-printers, and Shani Djamila, who manages both 
the shipping and the handling of the shirts.  The 
three of you don't maintain an office, but maintain a digital
workspace. Ennis and Shani both live in Vancouver, 
although you've never visited either - their apartments 
are every bit as shitty as yours. You meet at pubs, and 
occasionally co-work out of coworking offices or coffee shops. 

#### Ennis Laoghaire ####

Co-worker. "It's prounounced 'Ennis Leera'". Vancouver native,
Irish/Filipino parents (also Vancouver natives.)
A little pudgy, usually wears a close-cropped beard. 
Has a tendency to over-hyperbolize statements ("This is the 
finest coffee ever touched by human hands."). 

#### Shani Djamila ####

Co-worker. South Californian, with Indonesian parents, who
migrated from South Sulawesi. Fond of collared shirts, Bachelor's
degree in Business Administration. 

### The Apartment ###

A Vancouver micro-studio. 384 sq.ft. It has a separate bathroom,
bedroom, and living/kitchen, all of which are quite cramped. 

Next to your bed is an input/output stack of dirty and clean 
laundry in hampers. Your clothes are composed mostly of novelty
T-shirts covering funny things that have since happened on the 
internet and been forgotten, and faded jeans. 

You put on a shirt referencing an online joke where a person 
posted a humorous bad review of water on furrycurry.int 
"WATER: Crucial for life; A little bland. C+." 

4000 of these sold in the first day, at which point the interest
in the joke waned and your company discontinued the shirts.

### Library ###

The Library has pay-phones, but the thin phone directories contain
precious few phone numbers; they're mostly giant indices of 
assorted businesses. In order to avoid perpetual telespam, most
of your family and friends are unlisted. 

You do, however, know the number for emergency services, who 
agree to send a constable to your apartment. 

### Police Constable 1st Class Jeanne Javert ###

Jeanne is a middle-aged woman with the VPD's 
"Identity Crimes Unit". (The crest for which is an open eye 
with "ICU" printed beneath it. Officers do not find this 
particularly funny.) She is tired, and grumpy, and this is 
the second time today she's been called out to investigate 
a surgical identity theft. 

Jeanne wears her mostly-blonde-with-a-few-strands-of-silver hair
in a ponytail, can't be bothered to dye it. She is not particularly
tall, but manages to project an air of general unfuckwithability
nonetheless. 

She is entirely aware of the coincidence that a person with the 
last name "Javert" might be an officer of the law, and she is
getting pretty sick of hearing about it. Even so, she takes 
extra care not to be Lawful Stupid in the execution of her
day-to-day tasks in order to avoid needless comparisons. 

She will ask you to relate the events of your last evening, which
will give the player a chance to hear about them for the first time.

< PUT EVENTS HERE > 

You and your coworkers were out celebrating. Your most recent
meme-shirt really set a record for sales, and you've all made 
enough money to semi-retire. 

</ PUT EVENTS HERE > 

If you show her your scar, she will note that it looks to have been
a reasonably skilled extraction job.

She gives you a contact cube - a portable single-contact cel-phone -
that you can use to call her during normal work hours in the case 
that you learn something useful, or in the case that she needs to 
contact you for some reason. She also gives you a case reference
code, "JJ-29-54".

### TELUX Kiosk ###

You can, with some of your limited money supply, buy a small 
portable terminal with a Pay-As-You-Go data plan, and $10 top-up
cards to keep the data flowing. 

With the portable terminal, you can fish contact information for
your family out of the system.
