Locations
---------

### The Bathroom ###

The game starts in the bathroom.  You wake up, woozy and Disconnected, in a 
bathtub, sore and uncomfortable. There's drying blood about. Your arm is
clumsily wrapped in gauze. 

When you get up, to get out of the tub, you see yourself in the mirror, 
Which allows you to establish basic details about your appearance. 

You identify as:
> Male
> Female
> It's Complicated

If your skin color were a refreshing beer, it would be a
> Hefeveisen
> Lager
> Amber Ale
> Stout

Your hair is 
> Short & Black
> Medium & Brown
> Long & Blonde
> It's impossible to tell behind the luchadore mask. (absurd) 

You're not wearing any clothes. 

### Library ###

The Library has pay-phones, but the thin phone directories contain
precious few phone numbers; they're mostly giant indices of 
assorted businesses. In order to avoid perpetual telespam, most
of your family is unlisted. 

You do, however, know the number for emergency services. 

### TELUX Kiosk ###

You can, with some of your limited money supply, buy a small 
portable terminal with a Pay-As-You-Go data plan, and $10 top-up
cards to keep the data flowing. 

With the portable terminal, you can fish contact information for
your family out of the system.
