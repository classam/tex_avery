Some notes on a setting and story for this adventure game.

Vancouver 2029
--------------

It's Vancouver, approximately 15 years hence. 

Chips Ahoy
----------

Being as everybody is net-savvy at this point, and everything
is online at this point, the problems of authentication and
authorization have become more and more crucial to address.

Passwords are just so easy to break, and maintaining dozens
and dozens of user-name/password pairs becomes unwieldy when 
one's life is distributed amongst dozens of different systems.

In 2017, a small bio-tech firm, AuthentiCat (the logo of which
is a small black cat with a lock for a head), released a consumer
grade sub-dermal chip system.  Based on public-key crypto, each
sub-dermal chip contains a password-protected private key and a 
Bluetooth connection that can be used to authenticate the user
to a variety of sources. 

While there are security concerns - no system is unhackable - 
the AuthentiCat chips have proven more secure than most chip-and-pin
systems, and financial providers have started to phase out cards in
favour of AuthentiCats. Particularly paranoid 
users can keep their AuthentiCats extra-dermally, (key-chain FOBs
being a particularly popular option) but these units are much
more prone to theft. 

In 2023 the United States mandated AuthentiCat passports for 
travellers into the country. in order to smooth over border 
tensions after the 2018 Liberty Bell Incident, 

At this point, just about everything in one's life can comfortably
be authenticated and authorized with an AuthentiCat. Many people
have their entire lives attached to this one single private key. 

Chipless
--------

It's becoming harder and harder to be chipless. 

Some people are voluntarily chipless. It's common among privacy 
advocates, fundamentalist religiosos, criminals, libertarians,
and complete-and-utter-fucking-nutjobs. 

Some people are rendered involuntarily chipless. While the
AuthentiCat renders identity theft much more difficult, it's 
created a burgeoning industry of unethical street surgeons.
If someone manages to get someone's password, a roofie, a scalpel,
and a bathtub full of ice... well, let's just say that things
can become very complicated for that person, especially if they
happen the be the sort of early adopter who keeps everything 
in his life behind authenti-crypted doors. 

Like our protagonist, $NAME Jevons, who wakes up in their own 
bathtub, having had their AuthentiCat removed, surgically. This
isn't an amnesia story - because played out, right? - but they
honestly can't remember how it happened, past a rowdy night
out drinking with their buddies. 

They could consult the recorded video from his specs, but, first,
they're locked behind an Auth wall, and second, their specs 
have been stolen. 

$NAME is locked out of their entire life, and it doesn't take
long for them to realize that the chipless are treated like an
unwanted underclass in society. They can't get taxis, and cash 
transactions seem to come at a huge premium, if they're available
at all. None of their devices will recognize or even respond to them.
Public terminals are crowded and extremely limited.

The procedure for getting an AuthentiCat revoked and replaced is 
not a particularly easy one, either - $NAME's going to have to
survive for a few weeks while they waits for the wheels of bureacracy
to turn - their going to have to find three character references,
a copy of their birth certificate, a police report of their attack, 
and a single drop of blood. And they have to do each of these things 
without a phone, without their contacts, without their bank accounts,
and without their friends, because they're all online. 

They can't even talk to half of his neighbors without the 
Cantonese/Tagalog/Patois-Pidgin to English module installed in his 
X-Array Specs. 

Many stores tie payment directly to Chips, and have doors that 
only open for people with AuthentiCats.  

They will, however, learn a lot about how the Chipless manage to 
survive without identity. Maybe they'll even steal or
create a new identity for themselves. Have to survive somehow. 

X-Array Specs
-------------

Think "Google Glasses", but with a lot more polish.  There are
dozens of models from dozens of different providers - the Apple
iSee, the Microsoft Visual Vision 2025, the Samsung Galaxy of 
Gorgeous Bass Headset, but the Lemovo X-Array Specs are the
particular brand that $NAME is completely unable to use without
some sort of authentication. 

Over the course of the adventure, $NAME may borrow, buy, or
otherwise acquire snippets of older tech that allow him some of
his lost capabilities. Video, images, the ability to look at objects
in his environment and have a list of verbs come up for that object
automatically, some of his contacts, all of that good stuff. 

Other Features of the Universe
------------------------------

The Chips are the focus of this story, but the Vancouver 2029 universe
has a lot of fresh tech at hand to explore. 

The Ancients : Life Extension & Tinned Heads
--------------------------------------------

A lot of people are really excited about this one. With teleromase
extensions, boutique drugs, and grow-to-order organs, the natural 
life expectancy of a person in the top 30% of salaries ($150,000CAD/yr)
is trending at around 110 years. 

For people for whom a long natural life isn't in the cards, there's 
always the option of joining the Ancients.  A variety of companies 
are quite happy to put a brain in a jar of nutrient-rich sludge and 
plug that brain into the internet, replacing its dying cells with 
fresh-grown new ones, all-but-perpetually. This is still expensive 
- it comes in at about $2000 a month, which is a lot considering 
how long it'll be paying for the service.  The brain can always 
work it off, though - you'd be surprised at how much a brain can 
make in its new life as the intelligence guiding a train or a 
telephone switching station. 

We finally have immortality as an available option, and just like
most brand-new technologies it is ridden with bugs, drastic failures,
and only used by the earliest of early adopters. For one thing, the
sort of people who are most comfortable with the thought of an 
eternity trapped in a little metal box with an internet connection
are still in their 30s and 40s at this point.

This is bound to create a lot of long-term social issues. People aren't 
leaving jobs, digital jobs are being snapped up by dirt-cheap mind-labour,
and the sort of people who live entirely off of interest from their massive
holdings just aren't dying fast enough to allow their money to flow back into
the market. These are all serious problems, but none of them are serious
enough to make for widespread social change - yet.

What this means for the player is that they are likely to encounter ATM
machines and auto-taxis with a little bit more personality than they would
normally expect from inanimate devices. 

Moreover, the bottom 25% of the population hasn't just vanished, they still
remain. With Ancients increasingly acquiring the cushy office jobs of
yesterday more and more buildings have become vacant husks. In these the
impoverished dwell, and in these can be found the highest concentrations
of the Unchipped. Venturing into such a place is an unknown to $NAME, and
in their initial state they are surely to run afoul of nefarious deeds.

Strong AI
---------

Still nothin' on this front, although for extremely difficult computing applications,
a cluster of Ancients and some well-tuned machine learning algorithms can get a 
lot of work done very quickly.

Ecology & Electricity
---------------------

Oil is failing, fast, and so is the planet. Things are starting to get pretty fucked 
up, as the "mine it in Canada, ship it to China, manufacture it in China, ship it to 
Canada, and sell it" strategy is starting to become unsustainably expensive. 

The staggering and oft-ignored efficiency of rail comes back into
light.  Many airlines are going bankrupt at the sheer cost of keeping planes aloft
makes air travel unreasonable for all but the most affluent of passengers - and
the concept of battery-powered airplanes is at-best hilarious. Even the vast trucking
infrastructure of the U.S. and Canada is having trouble with the soaring cost
of gasoline. Ergo, more rail, and some of the first major rail development in North
America in the last 50 years. As of 2027, a high-speed West Coast passenger and light-freight
railway exists, linking Whistler, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and 
Los Angeles - and it can make it from end-to-end in about six hours.  

The buzzwords are _local_, _green_, and _bio_, and they're building steam as 
ecological disasters create more and more problems - but even if humanity 
manages to reach a new equilibrium, it's not going to be as idyllic as it was before.
The first East Coast Superhurricane was a real eye-opener. Vancouver - and its south
of the border counterpart, Seattle, are becoming Alpha cities, huge links in the
digital and trade economy of the world - partially because of the waning power of
the East Coast in the face of extreme weather difficulties. 

British Columbia and Ontario are managing surprisingly well, though. BC has
the hydroelecricity, and Ontario has the nuclear option.  Alberta is.. well, 
let's just say that Alberta is not totally a lost cause, but it's close. The
term 'pre-apocalyptic wasteland' comes to mind. Alberta sold their future, mostly
to Hong Kong businessmen.

Fusion experiments are promising and even positive-energy, but not at
anywhere near the scale required for wide-spread power generation. Some French 
physicists have managed to build up a lot of steam behind the Global
Electricity Project, and are currently constructing a pilot commercial
fusion facility - but the price-to-kilowatt-hour ratio of this new
technology currently lags behind even solar and wind.

There still exists individuals who believe that global warming is a hoax, and that
UN Agenda 23 is a plan to enact a single world Government at the expense of
individual liberty. Most of these people are unchipped, and ironically their
subversive activities make them magnets for law enforcement. However, they
are likely sources of black market munitions and certainly for aid in 
converting to an off-the-grid, unchipped lifestyle. Just be forewarned,
although the 9/11 commission was over two decades previously they will insist
on showing various proofs that it was an inside job.


Cybernetics, Augments, Biocybernetics and Datajacks
---------------------------------------------------

At what point does prosthetics become cybernetics? Even as far back as 2014, 
nervous-system-controlled prosthetic limbs were becoming available options for wealthy
amputees. The limbs never performed quite as smoothly or fluidly as real limbs
would, of course, but they've improved over time to be more resistant to the 
elements, lighter, more efficient with battery life. I think the real jumping-off
point between prosthetics and cybernetics is when the cybernetic limb is superior
to the original, and that is still not the case. Natural limbs don't have battery-life
issues, they're lighter, nimbler, more flexible, self-healing, and much more 
sensitive. Natural eyes perform faster saccades and don't overload the brain with 
out-of-focus data, and natural ears handle music and human speech better than 
any prosthetic to date. 

One could call these things 'cybernetics' once people would choose a prosthetic over 
their natural equipment - and we're not there yet. 

However, prosthetic research into direct neural interfaces has allowed for one common
human modification - a datajack. A special high-bandwidth IO card installed directly 
into the brain.  Because the datajack depends on natural neuroplasticity - can't install
drivers in the brain - learning a new cybernetic interface takes months of dedication
and in many cases dedicated physical therapy, but in doing so, humans can graft entirely
new interfaces on to their bodies.  These aren't bionic replacements, but fully operable
extra bits of equipment.  

The most common datajack augmentation amongst cube drones and desk jockeys is direct 
computeraccess - text-input and ui interaction. It takes some training to type directly 
with one's mind, but it's much more ergonomically sound.

Other professions often get datajack augmentations to provide other useful functions. 
Operating heavy machinery, for example. 

Companies responsible for growing 'boutique organs' for custom transplant are currently 
investing a lot of time and research into nervous-system tech and custom bio-implants, but
nothing of particular interest has come out of it, yet. 

Content & Influence
-------------------

The first decade of the 21st century was dominated by competing trends - a 
vastly increasing stable of digital media, combined with the
clear obsolescence of copyright in the face of remix culture and the 
complete nonexistance of digital scarcity. 

Digital Rights Management was an early attempt to manufacture digital scarcity, 
and Cloud Services became a much more successful second attempt.

So now there are two competing content spheres - library service providers who, 
for a fixed fee, provide unlimited access to large libraries of content, and 
online enclaves of nary-unlimited pirated content, with each doing their best
to attempt to extenguish the other. 

However, in both of the content spheres, eyeballs can translate almost directly 
into remuneration.  Content producers can choose exactly how much they are 
willing to subvert their message to corporate interests, and are paid on a
sliding scale, trading their message on online marketplaces like integrity.3am
and zlick.zap. 

Brand Personalities
-------------------

"Brand Experience" is a new watchword. Corporate wants everybody's experience 
at storefronts and kiosks to match with brand guidelines - so Kiosk employees
are instructed to adopt Brand Personalities.  These are more pervasive and 
far more comprehensive than simply service with a smile or mandatory pieces 
of flair. 

Salty Jack's Fish n' Chip-Hop Funk Marina was one of the first brands
to really embrace this philosophy - every Salty Jack's has the same character 
archetypes on staff. A surly-but-friendly Captain who loves bourbon (but not too
much) and who would be happy to tell you about his time at the Ballestas Islands. 
A skinny bartender who secretly-out-loud wants to be a DJ, but can't scrape
together the funds to get his equipment in order.  If you really grill the Captain, 
he'll admit to you that he's never been to the Ballestas Islands, it's just an
act that he puts on for the sake of working at Salty Jack's; he'll pour you a
scotch and soda and tell you about his wife and golden retriever. This, too, 
is a pre-planned part of the brand experience. 

Now there's a Salty Jack's at every pier in Canada and the United States, and 
the concept of detailed Brand Personalities with nested back-stories and recognizable
tics has developed massive resonance with most multi-nationals. 

Kiosk Puppets
-------------

In another push to create a more consistent Brand Experience, sales staff are 
often replaced by semi-self-serve Kiosks, managed by a combination of automation
and Ancients.  With careful training, and the work of some well-compensated 3d 
modelers, a small team of Ancients can really bring a Brand Personality to life.
Your fried chicken order will be taken by The Colonel himself, and he'll wink at
you and ask how your daughter's doing in Grade 3 - because he remembers that 
conversation you had six weeks ago; The Colonel is your friend, and he's always
interested how you've been doing.  

Direct Democratic
-----------------

In 2017, the Digital Democratic Party was formed in B.C. politics under the unusual 
platform that they did not actually have a platform at all. They instead
promised to bring each and every issue directly to their constituents for discussion
and debate before voting on it in Parliament. 

This was made possible by sophisticated software that they had designed
and open-sourced prior to the elections. 

It was 2026 before any Digital Democrats managed to score any seats - they managed to
get three, in remote ridings - but their odd-ball politics and sophisticated interactions
with their constituents made the news a number of times, and they're an increasingly
attractive candidate in the upcoming 2030 elections. 

The Direct Democrats have been criticized as giving too much electoral clout to the
sort of people who have vast reserves of free time to participate in the political
discussion - the elderly, office-workers,  and Ancients - but prominent DDP party 
leader Bryan Fung has dismissed this, claiming that these people had always enjoyed
some level of preferred treatment in the political process, being as they were the 
most likely to vote anyways. 

As a result, populist measures have become increasingly dominant as
key policy. Efforts to improve the lives of those who are outside the
accepted normal bounds of common society find it difficult to have
their concerns addressed by Government. This includes the
Unchipped. Fewer and fewer resources are expended to improve their
lives, while a growing malaise amongst the marginalized has given
birth to perpetual protest movements. Riots occur almost daily, and
are violently suppressed almost as fast as they occur.

Commonly referred to as professional protesters, these individuals
have ironically found a way to scrape out a living by repeatedly
finding themselves either incarcerated or living off the couch and
general good nature of those sympathetic to their cause. Ever since
the dramatic EI reforms of 2018 made it impossible to receive EI
unless you had already received assurance of future employment, this
method has become a primary means of survival for many.

Disconnect
----------
With ubquitous computing being old hat, most users exhibit a level of dependence on
their digital aids only exhibited by the most die-hard of techies today.  With 
devices providing a sort of 'extended brain' for users - the ability to query the
internet for anything, any time, local storage of notes, contacts, calendars, timetables, 
documents - users who are separated from their devices for a length of time experience a
phase colloquially called "Disconnect" - where they have difficulty operating without
computer guidance, content-rich distraction, and constant social interaction. 

Many people voluntarily travel to remote locations and Disconnect 
on purpose, just to feel like human beings again - although it's 
not long before they itch to once again connect themselves to the 
firehose of humanity. People who are involuntarily Disconnected 
have a much rougher time of it. 

It is not uncommon for those who experience Disconnect for the first
time to never undertake the action again. The shock of losing their
social feed and the gratification of constant awareness of their
friends' connectivity often leaves those Disconnecting in a state of
panic. Still, because of the retro-futurism of the concept and genuine
curiousity, it remains a semi-popular undertaking amongst youth.

It has given rise to the phrase "Disconnect, not even once."

On The Value of Identity Theft
------------------------------

With most of these things in place, the value of identity 
theft - and the consequences of losing one's online identity - 
become increasingly clear, as identities can be used 
for any number of purposes - for financial gain, as part of 
a digital content strategy, to influence politics, or simply 
to induce Disconnect in a rival as a way to get them
out of the way for a while without killing them. 

Telecommunications
------------------

The switched networks for telephones are pretty much null and
void at this point, as most of the major telcos have decommisioned
large swathes of them, replacing them with fiber-cable and VOIP. 

Most homes do not have phones, but instead dedicated VOIP+Data
service packages provided as a feed directly to their headsets. 

Vancouver is blanketed in a high-speed network that would put 
Kansas City to shame - with fiber connecting homes, and homes
acting as miniature cel-towers for high speed wireless data. 

The major telecommunications providers in the Vancouver area are 
TELUX (formed as a merger between TELUS and BELL, tagline: 
"The Future is Expensive", mascot: "ARPU D2") and Spring Mobile 
(A Sprint subsidiary that bought a lot of line from Rogers).

Sex
---

Pornography is everywhere, but not in the way those in the early 21st
century would have come to expect. Sex in the streets never came
about, and Playboy magazines no longer hide behind the top shelf at
London Drugs. Instead, the allusion to pornography is ever-present,
where marketers convey the tacit understanding to the viewer that they
share knowledge of the seedy side of the internet.

Vengeance & Fashion
-------------------

Clothing hasn't changed much, beyond that improved fabrics have
allowed textures and hues that sustain longer and in greater variety
than had previously. The digital revolution has made permanent the
revolution of fashion, and in combination with online reinforcement of
community the variety of accepted clothing ranges from burkas to
bikinis and back to bell bottoms. The fashion of any era, any place is certain to
find acceptance and can be seen in the streets of Vancouver.
