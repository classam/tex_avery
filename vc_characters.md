You
---

You work as a graphic designer at a local T-Shirt design 
collective that specializes in extremely fast print 
runs of shirts featuring up-to-the minute internet memes, 
selling these shirts during the memes' exact window of 
popularity, and then forgetting the shirts entirely and forever. 

You work with Ennis Laoghaire, who works with local 
screen-printers and manages shipping and handling, 
and Shani Djamila, who scans the entire internet for
trending memes daily. 

The three of you don't maintain an office, but maintain a digital
workspace. Ennis and Shani both live in Vancouver, 
although you've never visited either - their apartments 
are every bit as shitty as yours. You meet at pubs, and 
occasionally co-work out of coworking offices or coffee shops. 

Ennis Laoghaire
---------------
Co-worker. "It's prounounced 'Ennis Leera'". Vancouver native,
Irish/Filipino parents (also Vancouver natives.)
A little pudgy, usually wears a close-cropped beard and a 
cap. Not a hat, but a 'cap'. 
Has a tendency to over-hyperbolize statements ("This is the 
finest coffee ever touched by human hands."). 

The Business Administrator. Runs the production and delivery
side of things. 

Frequently volunteers as a part-time protestor and social activist
at the Vancouver Art Gallery Perpetual Protest. When he gets 
chiphacked, his first instinct is to hit the Airport for public
terminals and support from his Chipless cohorts. 


Shani Djamila
-------------

Co-worker. South Californian, with Indonesian parents, who
migrated from South Sulawesi. Total bit-head. Reads the 
entire internet every day. 

When she gets chiphacked, retreats to her parents' house. 

If you find her parents' house, and visit around dinner time, 
you can solve your food problem for the rest of the game.
They will load you down with so many calories that it almost
triggers the "Bursts At The Seams" ending. 

Police Constable 1st Class Jeanne Javert
----------------------------------------

Jeanne is a middle-aged woman with the VPD's 
"Identity Crimes Unit". (The crest for which is an open eye 
with "ICU" printed beneath it. Officers do not find this 
particularly funny.) She is tired, and grumpy, and this is 
the second time today she's been called out to investigate 
a surgical identity theft. 

Jeanne wears her mostly-blonde-with-a-few-strands-of-silver hair
in a ponytail, can't be bothered to dye it. She is not particularly
tall, but manages to project an air of general unfuckwithability
nonetheless. 

She is entirely aware of the coincidence that a person with the 
last name "Javert" might be an officer of the law, and she is
getting pretty sick of hearing about it. Even so, she takes 
extra care not to be Lawful Stupid in the execution of her
day-to-day tasks in order to avoid needless comparisons. 

TELUX ARPU D2 
-------------

The TELUX kiosk is manned by ARPU D2, a digitally rendered android
who's happy to help you compare cel-phone plans. 

God of Memes
------------

A hacker who works in the field of public opinion manipulation to 
create and shape viral media. 

Purposefully indeterminate gender. 

(s)he knows guys at readit and dugg-dugg, (s)he writes articles for BoingSproing,
(s)he has access to the codebase for a few-dozen social platforms, 
knows h(er/is) way around phishing and social engineering, and generally 
spends most of h(er/is) time just soaking in data. 

God of Memes has h(er/is) thumb on the internet popularity scale. (S)he doesn't 
craft content on h(er/is) own, but (s)he's a power broker for internet virality. 

Why?  Not for wealth - although (s)he does sell a little 
influence on the side here and there to afford to live - (s)he does it 
for the Internet Points - of which (s)he has almost eight million, at this
point. 

Oh, (s)he loves your company's shirts, by the way, although (s)he'd like it if
you'd make them out of more long-lasting cottons. 

Ex-TELUX Executive
------------------

Recently fired after launching the poorly thought out "ygolohcysP esreveR"
ad campaign. Mortgaged to the hilt, couldn't find another job, soon ended
up drinking and, well, long-story-short, now he lives at the Airport. 

Can tell you all about tmiyoh.3am. 

The Surgeon
-----------

A contractor through tmiyoh.3am, under the handle the_surgeon. Your chiphacker.

Bright red hair and very steady hands. 

He's a real professional.  He's done over 18 live chiphacks, and he hasn't 
lost a patient, yet.  It pays very well, and he justifies what he's doing
as a humanitarian project - people are going to get chiphacked anyways, but
so long as he's the one doing it, the targets are a lot less likely to 
get seriously injured during the procedure.

Even so, though, he does have to work _quickly_, and discreetly. 

He subcontracts out the preparation and procurement of his various drugs and
knockout gases to another tmiyoh.3am contractor, grand_duchess_anaesthesia.
