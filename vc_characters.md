You
---

Name:
 * NAME 

You identify as:
 * Male
 * Female
 * It's Complicated

If your build and skin color were a refreshing beer, it would be
 * A tall sleeve of Hefeveisen
 * A pint of Lager
 * A mug of Amber Ale
 * Short & Stout

Your hair is 
 * Short & Black
 * Medium & Brown
 * Long & Blonde

You're not wearing any clothes. 

You have a long tattoo of an asian-style dragon running from
your thighbone up the side of your torso, alongside the chinese
character for "SOUP".  It was a funny nod to a common joke 
("The tattoo artist said it meant 'Honor'") at the time, but you're
starting to regret it. 

You work as a graphic designer at a local T-Shirt design 
collective that specializes in extremely fast print 
runs of shirts featuring up-to-the minute internet memes, 
selling these shirts during the memes' exact window of 
popularity, and then forgetting the shirts entirely and forever. 

You work with Ennis Laoghaire, who works with local 
screen-printers, and Shani Djamila, who manages both 
the shipping and the handling of the shirts.  The 
three of you don't maintain an office, but maintain a digital
workspace. Ennis and Shani both live in Vancouver, 
although you've never visited either - their apartments 
are every bit as shitty as yours. You meet at pubs, and 
occasionally co-work out of coworking offices or coffee shops. 

Ennis Laoghaire
---------------
Co-worker. "It's prounounced 'Ennis Leera'". Vancouver native,
Irish/Filipino parents (also Vancouver natives.)
A little pudgy, usually wears a close-cropped beard. 
Has a tendency to over-hyperbolize statements ("This is the 
finest coffee ever touched by human hands."). 

Shani Djamila
-------------

Co-worker. South Californian, with Indonesian parents, who
migrated from South Sulawesi. Fond of collared shirts, Bachelor's
degree in Business Administration. 

Police Constable 1st Class Jeanne Javert
----------------------------------------

Jeanne is a middle-aged woman with the VPD's 
"Identity Crimes Unit". (The crest for which is an open eye 
with "ICU" printed beneath it. Officers do not find this 
particularly funny.) She is tired, and grumpy, and this is 
the second time today she's been called out to investigate 
a surgical identity theft. 

Jeanne wears her mostly-blonde-with-a-few-strands-of-silver hair
in a ponytail, can't be bothered to dye it. She is not particularly
tall, but manages to project an air of general unfuckwithability
nonetheless. 

She is entirely aware of the coincidence that a person with the 
last name "Javert" might be an officer of the law, and she is
getting pretty sick of hearing about it. Even so, she takes 
extra care not to be Lawful Stupid in the execution of her
day-to-day tasks in order to avoid needless comparisons.

who's happy to help you compare cel-phone plans.
