Vancouver 2029
==============

Some notes on a setting and story for this adventure game.

It's Vancouver, approximately 15 years hence. 

Chips Ahoy
----------

Being as everybody is net-savvy at this point, and everything
is online at this point, the problems of authentication and
authorization became more and more crucial to address.

Passwords are just so easy to break, and maintaining dozens
and dozens of username/password pairs becomes unwieldy when 
your life is distributed amongst dozens of different systems.

In 2017, a small biotech firm, AuthentiCat (the logo of which
is a small black cat with a lock for a head), released a consumer
grade subdermal chip system.  Based on public-key crypto, each
subdermal chip contained a password-protected private key and a 
bluetooth connection that could be used to authenticate the user
to a variety of sources. 

    Side-note: From a real-life security standpoint, this is, of
    course, only as secure as the terminal that is communicating
    with the chip. Let's gloss over fine details, here - we're 
    not actually implementing this thing. 

While there were security concerns - no system is unhackable - 
the AuthentiCat chips proved more secure than most chip-and-pin
systems, and financial providers started to phase out cards in
favour of AuthentiCats. Of course, particularly paranoid 
users could keep their AuthentiCats extradermally, (key-chain FOBs
being a particularly popular option) but these units were more 
more prone to theft. 

In 2023 the United States - in order to smooth over security-based 
border tensions after the 2018 Liberty Bell Incident, mandated 
AuthentiCat passports for travellers into the country.

At this point, just about everything in one's life can comfortably
be authenticated and authorized with an AuthentiCat. Many people
have their entire lives attached to this one single private key. 

Chipless
--------
Of course, with all that in mind, it's becoming harder and harder
to be chipless. 

Some people are voluntarily chipless. It's common among privacy 
advocates, fundamentalist religiosos, criminals, libertarians,
and complete-and-utter-fucking-nutjobs. 

Some people are rendered involuntarily chipless. While the
AuthentiCat renders identity theft much more difficult, it's 
created a burgeoning industry of unethical street surgeons.
If someone manages to get someone's password, a roofie, a scalpel,
and a bathtub full of ice... well, let's just say that things
can become very complicated for that person, especially if they
happen the be the sort of early adopter who keeps everything 
in his life behind authenti-crypted doors. 

Like our protagonist, Stanley Jevons, who wakes up in his own 
bathtub, having had his AuthentiCat removed, surgically. This
isn't an amnesia story - because played out, right? - but he
honestly can't remember how it happened, past a rowdy night
out drinking with his buddies. 

Stanley is locked out of his entire life, and it doesn't take
long for him to realize that the chipless are treated like an
unwanted underclass in society. He can't get taxis, and cash 
transactions seem to come at a huge premium, if they're available
at all. None of his devices will recognize or even respond to him.
Public terminals are crowded and extremely limited.

The procedure for getting an AuthentiCat revoked and replaced is 
not a particularly easy one, either - Stanley's going to have to
survive for a few weeks while he waits for the wheels of bureacracy
to turn - he's going to have to find three character references,
a copy of his birth certificate, a police report of his attack, 
and a single drop of blood from a live unicorn. And he has to do 
all of these things without a phone, without his contacts, without
his bank accounts, without his friends, because they're all online. 

He can't even talk to half of his neighbors without the Mandarin 
to English module installed in his X-Array Specs.

He will, however, learn a lot about how the Chipless manage to 
survive without identity. Maybe he'll even steal or
create a new identity for himself. Have to survive somehow. 

X-Array Specs
-------------

Think "Google Glasses", but with a lot more polish.  There are
dozens of models from dozens of different providers - the Apple
iSee, the Microsoft Visual Vision 2025, the Samsung Galaxy of 
Gorgeous Bass Headset, but the Lemovo X-Array Specs are the
particular brand that Stanley is completely unable to use without
some sort of authentication. 

Over the course of the adventure, Stanley may borrow, buy, or
otherwise acquire snippets of older tech that allow him some of
his lost capabilities. Video, images, the ability to look at objects
in his environment and have a list of verbs come up for that object
automatically, some of his contacts, all of that good stuff. 

Other Features of the Universe
------------------------------

The Chips are the focus of this story, but the Vancouver 2029 universe
has a lot of fresh tech at hand to explore. 

The Ancients : Life Extension & Tinned Heads
--------------------------------------------

A lot of people are really excited about this one. With teleromase
extensions, boutique drugs, and grow-to-order organs, the natural 
life expectancy of a person in the top 30% of salaries ($150,000CAD/yr)
is trending at around 110 years. 

For people for whom a long natural life isn't in the cards, there's 
always becoming one of the Ancients.  A variety of companies are quite
happy to put your brain in a jar of nutrient-rich sludge and plug you 
into the internet, replacing your dying cells with fresh-grown new ones,
all-but-perpetually. This is still expensive - it comes in at about $2000
a month, which is a lot considering how long you'll be paying for the
service.  You can always work it off, though - you'd be surprised how much
you can make in your new life as the intelligence guiding a train or a 
telephone switching station. 

We finally have immortality as an available option, and just like most
brand-new technologies it is ridden with bugs, drastic failures, and only
used by the earliest of early adopters. For one thing, the sort of people
who are most comfortable with the thought of an eternity trapped in a 
little metal box with an internet connection are still in their 30s and
40s at this point.

This is bound to create a lot of long-term social issues. People aren't 
leaving jobs, digital jobs are being snapped up by dirt-cheap mind-labour,
and the sort of people who live entirely off of interest from their massive
holdings just aren't dying fast enough to allow their money to flow back into
the market. These are all serious problems, but none of them are serious
enough to make for widespread social change - yet.

What this means for the player is that they are likely to encounter ATM
machines and auto-taxis with a little bit more personality than they would
normally expect from inanimate devices. 

Strong AI
---------

Still nothin' on this front, although for extremely difficult computing applications,
a cluster of Ancients and some well-tuned machine learning algorithms can get a 
lot of work done very quickly.

Ecology & Oil
-------------

Oil is failing, fast, and so is the planet. Things are starting to get pretty fucked 
up, as the "mine it in Canada, ship it to China, manufacture it in China, ship it to 
Canada, and sell it" strategy is starting to become unsustainably expensive. 

The buzzwords are _local_ and _green_, and _bio_, and they're building steam as 
ecological disasters create more and more problems - but even if humanity 
manages to reach a new equilibrium, it's not going to be as idyllic as it was before.
The first East Coast Superhurricane was a real eye-opener. Vancouver - and it's south
of the border counterpart, Seattle, are becoming Alpha cities, huge links in the
digital and trade economy of the world - partially because of the waning power of
the East Coast in the face of extreme weather difficulties. 

British Columbia and Ontario are managing surprisingly well, though. BC has
the hydroelecricity, and Ontario has the nuclear option.  Alberta is.. well, 
let's just say that Alberta is not totally a lost cause, but it's close. The
term 'pre-apocalyptic wasteland' comes to mind.
